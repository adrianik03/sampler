  	<h1>Some Common Block Tags</h1>

  	<h3>hr</h3>
    <!--Creates that horizontal line going across page-->
  	<p>The hr element used to stand for "horixontal line" and that is still how it is typically displayed by browsers. However, in HTML5 the tag took on a semantic meaning, "semantic break." I will be using it often to break up example file swhen I want to display tags in one file.</p>
  	<hr>

    <h3>address</h3>
    <p>The address element incicates that the text is an address specific to the page, perhaps contact information for the author.</p>
    <address>
      3 Long Creek Rd. <br>
      Austin, TX, 78737<br>
    </address>
    <hr>

    <h3>blockquote</h3>
    <p>The blockquote element is used for extended quotations. It should include the cite attribute in order to show or link to the source of the quote.</p>
    <blockquote cite="Napolean_Hill">
      "If you cannot do great things, do small things in a great way." Napolean Hill
    </blockquote>
    <hr>

    <h3>details</h3>
    <p>The details element is used in conujunction with the summary tag. It is one of the tags that was created in response to the repeated use of scripting open and close content. It is not supported by all browsers yet though.</p>
    <details>
      <summary>The summary</summary>
      <p>The rest of the details content go here. If only details element is not supported, then the summary and the content are always visible</p>
    </details>
    <hr>




    <h1>Inline Elements</h1>
      <p>Why do we bother with inline elements> There are certainly times we want to mark up content, but we don't want to insert the line breaks around them. The span tag was the first to give you that ability, but it was mostly used to style the code, and we don't want to do that. Some of the newer tags that still seperate content and style are listed below. Remember, inline tags can flow next to each other and don't cause a line break before and after the element. We have seen this with links and images.</p>
      <hr>

      <h3>Citing a source-cite</h3>
      <p>The cite makes it much easier for people and bots to search the code for this specific information.</p>
      <p><cite><a href="https://www.edvardmunch.org/the-scream.jsp" target="_blank">The Scream</a></cite> By Edward Munch. Painted in 1893.</p>
      <hr>

      <h3>Defining your abbreviations- abbr</h3>
        <p>The abbr will display an abbreviation on the browser. But if a title attribute is specified in the tag, the title will appear when the mouse hovers over the abbreviation. Screen readers also provide the title information.</p>
        <p>The days of the week are often abbreviated: <abbr title="Sunday">Sun</abbr>, <abbr title="Monday">Mon</abbr>, etc.</p>
      <hr>

      <h3>Specifying the use of time- time</h3>
        <p>The time is again a completely semantic tag that can be used to search for specific information.</p>
        <p>The party starts at <time>9:00pm</time>.</p>
        <p>The party took place on <time>New Year's Eve.</time></p>
      <hr>

      
      <h3>Identifying code fragments- code</h3>
        <p>The code element tends to be displayed ina  different font, but also has the semantic meaning to convey information to as many people as possible.</p>
        <p>I have been trying to learn hwo to write html but my <code>img</code> elements never seem to work.</p>
      <hr>

      <h3>Using subscripts and superscripts- sub and sup</h3>
        <p>The sub and sup elements are used to create the super and subscripts, e.g. (x+y)<sup>3</sup> or H<sub>2</sub>O. In the past, people would often paste mathematical images into the page. But images didn't convey the same meaning to all users.</p>
      <hr>




    <h1>Special tags that need "more"</h1>
    <h3>button</h3>
      <p>Here is an example of the button tag. It is a little but misleading since it is a button that doesn't do anything. You would want to add some interactivity, perhaps with JavaScript.</p>
        <button type="button">Open</button>
          <br>
        <button type="button">Close</button>
    <hr>

    <h3>meter</h3>
      <p>The meter tag is cool and can take a lot of attributes. But again it is better if you have some code that can make the attribute values dynamic instead of "hardcoding" them. When you think meter, think of a final score for a test.</p>
      <meter min="0" max="100" value="50">50%</meter><br>
      <meter min="0" max="100" value="1">1%</meter><br>
      <meter min="5" max="10" value="8">60%</meter><br>
    <hr>

    <h3>progress</h3>
      <p>The progress tag has a very similar layout to the meter tag.</p>
        <label for="file">Downloading progress:</label>
        <progress id="file" value="32" max="100"> 32% </progress>
    <hr>

    <h3>iframe</h3>
      <p>The iframe is used to nest content.</p>
      <iframe src="http://www.intro-webdesign.com">
      </iframe><br>

      <p>You can set the width to something greater.</p>
      <iframe src="http://www.intro-webdesign.com" width="1200px"></iframe>
    <hr>


    <h3>bdo</h3>
      <p>bdo stands for bidirectional override. This tag can be used to change the direction of the text.</p>
      <p><bdo dir="ltr">This text will go left to right</bdo></p>
        <p><bdo dir="rtl">This text will go right to left.</bdo></p>
  </body>
